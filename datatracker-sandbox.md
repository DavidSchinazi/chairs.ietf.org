This test instance of the [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org) is for use in training sessions during and between meetings. This is a great way to experiment with various features of the IETF Datatracker and get more familiar with its capabilities, without actually making any changes to the production system.

It is kept in sync with the current datatracker release. The database is resynchronized daily (which means any changes you make will be overwritten by a copy of the production database within a day).

You can login with any valid username (log in as users with different roles to see how the views change by role). All account passwords have been set to 'password'.

It is safe to perform any action as the production database will not be affected. It is even safe to perform actions that would send mail in the production system. Any mail that this instance sends is wrapped in a container and sent to the sandbox-mailouput@ietf.org mailing list. It is *not* sent to the original target addresses.

You can find this test instance at http://sandbox.ietf.org.

You can inspect any mail this instance sends by looking at this [archive for the sandbox-mailoutput list](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=sandbox-mailoutput.).

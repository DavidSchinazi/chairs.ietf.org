# Submitting Agendas
For the convenience of meeting attendees, please submit the agendas for your working group sessions as early as possible, but by no later than 12:00 ET (17:00 GMT) on the Monday of the week preceding the IETF Meeting. If you prefer to submit your agenda via e-mail rather than using the [IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org), then please send it to agenda@ietf.org.

# Submitting Minutes and Presentation Slides
Please submit your minutes and presentation slides for inclusion in the IETF meeting proceedings by no later than four weeks from the Friday of the meeting week at 17:00 ET (21:00 GMT). If you prefer to submit your minutes and presentation slides via e-mail rather than using the datatracker
then please send them to proceedings@ietf.org. To ensure that your materials are not flagged as SPAM, please use "IETF-XXX Proceedings Submission" as the "Subject" line. (Where XXX is the meeting number). 

## Submission of minutes is mandatory
Minutes may be submitted in plain tet (Unix/Mac/Dos), in simple HTML with NO style sheets, and PDF. Minutes submitted with style sheets WILL BE converted to plain text. Therefore, if you are concerned about preserving the formatting of your minutes, then please submit them in simple HTML.

## Submission of presentation slides is optional.
Presentation slides may be submitted in any of the following formats: 
- TXT Plain text (Unix / macos / MS-DOS) 
- DOC MS Word Document (v 95 - latest version) 
- PDF Adobe Portable Document Format (Acrobat 3 - latest version) 
- PPT MS PowerPoint (v 95 - latest version)


For incorporation into the proceedings, presentation slides submitted in ppt and doc **will be** converted to html and pdf, respectively. 

When submitting slides for multiple presentations, please indicate the order that the presentations should appear in the proceedings. If you use the "IETF Datatracker" to submit your presentation slides, then you can order the presentations via the interface provided. If you submit your presentation slides by e-mail, then please indicate the desired order by completing a "Proceedings Submission Form." For your convenience, "Proceedings Submission Forms" are available online in both [PDF](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/proceedings-form.pdf) and [Microsoft Word DOC](https://www7.ietf.org/media/documents/proceedings-form.doc) formats.

Either version of the form may be printed in advance, completed on site, and turned in at the registration desk following the conclusion of your working group session. The Word form may also be completed electronically and submitted by e-mail along with the presentation slides. Please note that hard copies of the "Proceedings Submission Forms" will no longer be provided in the meeting rooms. 

# Posting of Materials on the IETF Web Site

If you submit your meeting materials using the IETF Datatracker, then they will be posted on the IETF Meeting Materials Web page in their original formats and made available to the public as soon as they are uploaded. For incorporation into the proceedings, they will be processed to conform with established proceedings standards (as described above). 

If you submit your meeting materials via email, then they will be processed to conform with established proceedings standards prior to being posted, and will be available on the IETF Meeting Materials Web page within 48 hours after receipt. 

Please review your processed materials online and send any corrections to proceedings@ietf.org. The deadline for submitting corrections is two weeks from the submission deadline (or six weeks from the Friday of the meeting week).

# The IETF Meeting Materials Manager

The IETF Meeting Materials Manager is part of the IETF Datatracker that makes meeting materials available to the community before, during, and after an IETF meeting (as appropriate), and for submitting them for inclusion in the IETF meeting proceedings. For each IETF meeting, WG or RG Chairs and WG Secretaries (the user) will have access to the meeting materials from the date that the working group and BoF session scheduling begins until the deadline for submitting corrections to the proceedings.

The IETF Meeting Materials Manager cannot be used to upload BoF materials until the BoF has been approved by the IESG, and is entered into the Datatracker by the Secretariat. Once a BoF has been approved, the BoF Chair may use the "Meeting Materials Manager” to submit meeting materials.

## User Account Information

The tool is part of the IETF Datatracker, and each WG, RG, or BoF Chair or Secretary should have the appropriate access to upload or edit materials for the meetings.

## Features and Capabilities

Upon logging in to the datatracker, the user should go to the datatracker page for their working group/research group/BoF. Click on the “Meetings” tab to get to the meetings page (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/[insert WG/RG/BoF acronym here]/meetings/) to upload materials.  For example, a Chair or Secretary may wish to upload minutes from a face-to-face or interim meeting, or submit an initial agenda for a session to be held at the next IETF meeting.

The user should click on the “Edit Materials” link for the meeting they want to upload material for. For each meeting instance that has the “Edit Materials” link active, the user may upload a new or revised agenda. They may also upload presentation slides, reorder the presentation slides (using the drag and drop feature), and link draft Internet-Drafts to the session. After the sessions, the user can upload final versions of these materials as well as the minutes until the upload window closes for the meeting.

All uploaded materials for a numbered IETF Meeting (i.e. IETF 108) will be available to the public on the "IETF Meeting Materials" Web page as soon as they are submitted. Therefore, they can be viewed and downloaded before or during the session. The URL for the "IETF Meeting Materials" Web page is:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/XXX/materials.html (where XXX is the number of the meeting, e.g., "107" for IETF 107).

## File Formats for Uploaded Materials

The datatacker will accept and post materials in the following formats:
- Agendas: text, and html
- Minutes: text, html, and pdf
- Presentation slides: text, pdf, ppt, and doc

However, when they are incorporated into the proceedings, presentation slides submitted in ppt or doc will be converted to html and pdf, respectively.

If the user missed the deadline to upload materials for the proceedings, they may send their materials to proceedings@ietf.org and the Secretariat will upload the materials for them.

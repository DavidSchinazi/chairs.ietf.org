# Setting the time and date
Working Group chairs should discuss plans for scheduling virtual interim meetings with Area Directors, including any considerations for not conflicting with Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) meetings and avoiding periods around IETF meetings during which the IESG has determined interim meetings should not be held.
Meetings must be scheduled so that they provide fair access for all working group participants (and are announced at least one week—and preferably two weeks—in advance).
# Choosing the conferencing platform
Any conferencing platform may be chosen by chairs for a virtual interim meeting. The IETF provides support for both Webex and Meetecho, with instructions provided below. If another platform (such as Jitsi, Google Meet, or Zoom) is chosen, please skip to the “Adding the meeting to  the IETF Datatracker” section of this document.
## Using Meetecho
> NOTE: During these steps, be sure to leave open both the browser windows for the IETF Datatracker and Meetecho.
{.is-success}
1. Ensure you are logged into the IETF Datatracker as a WG Chair or WG Secretary.
2. Open the Meetecho session request form in a new web browser window (keeping the IETF Datatracker window open) and press the green “plus” icon next to the working group acronym.
3. Copy the URL in the Meetecho Link field, which will be used in the IETF Datatracker session request form’s `Remote Instructions` field. 
4. In a separate web browser window (keeping the Meetecho webpage open), use the IETF Datatracker session request form , and enter the requested information, including the URL from Meetecho in the `Remote Instructions` field.
5. When complete, press the submit button on the IETF Datatracker sesion request form.
6. Navigate to the Interim Meetings to be Announced tab in the IETF Datatracker and copy the session name (e.g. interim-2021-wgname-01)
7. Then in the Meetecho session request form, enter in the session name assigned from the IETF Datatracker (e.g. interim-2021-wgname-01) into the `SESSION` field, and complete the rest of the Meetecho form (e.g. start date and time, as well as the duration).
> NOTE: You may skip to section 4. below.
## Using Webex
1. Log into the IETF Webex dashboard using the IETF-provided Webex account credentials. (A WG chair may request an account via the Webex Account Request form.)
2. Click the `Schedule a Meeting` button.
3. Set the meeting topic to `[WG ACRONYM] working group interim`.
4. Select the planned date and  time.
5. Select the desired timezone.
6. Add an agenda, if desired (not required) by using: `Show advanced options > Agenda`
7. Keep `public meeting` selected by using: `Show advanced options > Scheduling options > Public meeting > Listed on public calendar`
8. Select `automatic recording` to avoid having to manually start recording as the interim meeting starts by using:
`Show advanced options > Scheduling options > Automatic recording > Automatically start recording when the meeting starts`

# Adding the meeting to the IETF Datatracker 
> NOTE: This step has already been completed if you have followed step 2 in the instructions for Meetecho above.
{.is-info}

1. Fill out the Interim Meeting Request form. (NOTE: You will need to log into IETF Datatracker as WG chair and will need details about the meeting, including the URL for the conferencing system being used.)
2. You may later update or add information (such as the agenda).

# Communicating about the meeting
1. Adding the meeting to the IETF Datatracker will cause the IETF Secretariat to announce the meeting. Once the meeting has been announced, it will be visible from the Meetings tab on the WG's Datatracker page and in the IETF Datatracker’s upcoming meeting list.
2. Working Group chairs or secretaries should send an email reminder to the WG email list several days before the meeting with links to the agenda and conferencing coordinates.


# Preparing for the meeting
1. When logged into IETF Datatracker as a WG Chair, upload the meeting agenda via the Meetings tab on the WG's Datatracker page.
2. When logged into IETF Datatracker as a WG Chair, upload any slides or meeting materials to the Meetings tab on the WG's Datatracker page.


# Running the meeting
1. Remember to start recording if you haven't set up an automatic recording in Webex or other platforms; Meetecho automatically records the session.
> NOTE: If you are NOT using IETF-provided Webex or Meetecho, you will need participants to provide affirmative consent for recordings.
{.is-info}

2. Provide a reminder of the IETF Note Well.


Following up from the meeting
Upload recording to the IETF YouTube channel: 
This will be done automatically within a week if the meeting was held using IETF Webex or Meetecho.
If the meeting was held using another platform, send email to support@ietf.org to have the recording uploaded.
Upload the meeting minutes to the  IETF Datatracker when logged into IETF Datatracker as a WG Chair. (Or, if this is not possible, send email to support@ietf.org).
You may also post notes to the working group meeting email list.

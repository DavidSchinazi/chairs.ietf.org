## Updating milestones
Milestones for a working group should be edited via the IETF Datatracker.  
- On the working group charter page, click on the "Edit Milestones" button at the top of the page.  

- On the resulting page is a list of the current active milestones for the working group.

To make any changes to exsisting milestones, you must expand the milestone to show all choices. Clicking on the milestone expands the action choices.  

To mark a milestone as "DONE," put a check mark in the "Resolved" box. This action does not require Area Director approval.

To change the date a milestone is due, click on the due date and use the pop up to change the year and month the milestone is due. This action does not require AD approval. 

To add a new milestone to the list, click on the "Add extra milestone for Area Director review" button and fill in the information as necessary. This action requires AD approval.

Once you have changed/added the milestones, click on the blue "Review changes" button.  This will take you to a page where you can see all of your changes/additions before they are accepted.

If the milestones are correct, click on the blue "Save" button. Note the "Awaiting accept" flag next to the new milestone. This means on clicking the "Save" button, email will be sent to the Area Director from the datatracker to alert them there are milestone changes they need to approve. Once the Area Director has approved the new milestones, they will appear on the charter page.

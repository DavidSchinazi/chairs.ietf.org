IETF mailing lists are the primary discussion forums for IETF Working Groups. While groups may also use in-person or online meetings, and platforms such as Github to raise, suggest or discuss issues initially, these should be brought to the WG mailing list so that a group position can be determined.

IETF Working Group lists are generally open to anyone with an email address.
